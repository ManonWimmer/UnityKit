Package : Save System

In order to use this save system, you only need to set in your scene the "Save Manager" prefab
In this Save Manager, you can had save entries
	- Select a GameObject, choose to save Transform (position - rotation - scale)
	- Select specific scripts in the GameObject -> for each script, select which variables to save

In next update : option to save variables of a specific script in each script instance (ex: save variable EnemyHealth for each Enemy script in the scene)
